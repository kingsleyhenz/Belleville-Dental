            <span>Children's oral health:</span>
            <p> It's important to start caring for a child's teeth from an early age. Parents should start cleaning their baby's gums with a soft cloth or infant toothbrush before teeth even appear. Once teeth come in, parents should start brushing with a small amount of fluoride toothpaste. Children should see a dentist by their first birthday and have regular check-ups every six months. To prevent tooth decay, parents should limit sugary foods and drinks, encourage healthy eating habits, and make sure children brush their teeth twice a day for two minutes each time.</p>
